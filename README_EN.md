The Stable Release channel defaultly include one .zip package and another .exe package for Windows platform, alone with an .Appimage package packed under Endeavour OS Linux (Arch-based) for Linux users.

## üìåNotice When Using:
- #### 1.This APP is developed with Electron framework. Thus, the APP supports cross-platform and can run on Windows, MacOS and Linux. We only provide Windows and Linux installation pack in our Release. If you want to run the APP on MacOS, pls clone the repository using `git clone` and pack locally by yourself.
- #### 2.When using the default NLP service, please notice that do not post TOO many request to reach our free API limit. We suggest you to register your own TCloud API by yourself, and fill your own API URL into the custom API blank in Settings. Knowing how to register your API, Please view the Appendix below.
- #### 3.The model files used in this project are copyrighted by the relevant copyright holders. Now the project has provided the option of self-built model API in the settings->Customize, and has added the local model loading function in the settings->Laboratory to avoid this restriction.
- #### 4.Due to the use of Electron for building, the performance overhead is slightly larger, also with higher power consumption, thus it's not recommended for notebooks, we suggest you to use it on your desktop for consumption.

## ü§îFAQ
* Q:Why doesn't the live2d model show up when I open the kanban?
* A:Depending on the network condition, you need to get the model data from the model API when you use it for the first time. Since the default API server does not have enough bandwidth (poor), it may take some time to load, please be patient or fill in other API address in the setting interface to improve the loading speed. In the future, this project will add local loading function to remedy this problem.
- Q:How can I turn off the ringing of the schedule reminder?
- A:You can turn off the ringing by clicking on the schedule notification poped-up after setting the schedule arrival time.
* Q:When will supports for moc3 model and native model files be added?
* A:Good question, the local model loading mode has been basically developed (it only works) and has been testing openly in the Prerelease channel, moc3 support is now on the schedule and will soon come out in the next version of the software.

## üìùAppendix:
- 1.If you need to apply for Tencent NLP natural language processing service by yourself, you can refer to the predecessor of this project - the web version of AI Watcher's NLP building tutorial, the link is as follows:[Deploy Tutorial](https://github.com/JimHans/AI-waifu)
- 2.The new local mode is still unstable and requires the `hit_areas_custom` configuration inside the model configuration manifest Json file in order to read the touch range and thus respond to the touch behavior. Other configurations that need attention I will sort out in the future. The corresponding Json visual configuration feature will also be included in the development plan in the future.
- 3.To use the ChatGPT Chat mode, you must have a OpenAI Account and the API Key. The software use the official API to get requests.
